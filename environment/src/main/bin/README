This directory is mapped (filtered) to: <Project home>/bin

Place here your additional scripts. Files having .sh,.pl and .py extensions will be automatically chmoded +x.

You can place here you custom Service startup scripts, eventually overriding any distribution file, 
but this is not normally needed and is otherwise not suggested (being unsupported by Release team)
apart from deploying custom services.

Following cases are supported (via relevant skel script):

- nginx:               create here a custom nginx startup script (overriding default)
                       with name nginx.sh
- memcached:           create here a custom memcached startup script (overriding default)
                       with name memcached.sh
- spawn-fcgi:          create here a custom fcgi respawning script (overriding default)
                       with name spawn-fcgi.sh
- sphinx:              create here a custom sphinx startup script (overriding default)
                       with name sphinx.sh
- postfix:             create here a custom postfix startup script (overriding default)
                       with name postfix.sh
- rabbitmq-server:     create here a custom postfix startup script (overriding default)
                       with name rabbitmq-server.sh
- openresty:           create here a custom openresty startup script (overriding default)
                       with name openresty.sh
